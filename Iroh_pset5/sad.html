          <h1 class="page-title">Mohism Philosophy</h1>
          <p>
            Mohism is the school of Chinese philosophy founded by Mozi in the 5th century. Mozi taught the necessity for individual piety and submission to the will of heaven, or Shangdi (Lord on High), and deplored the Confucian emphasis on rites and ceremonies as a waste of government funds.

In contrast to the Confucian moral ideal of ren (“humanity” or “benevolence”), which differentiated the special love for one’s parents and family from the general love shown to fellow men, the Mohists advocated the practice of love without distinctions (jianai).

          <p class="dark">Applying this philosophy to your life, makes facing confrontation problems easier, since instead of getting appart with the other person you just try to understand how they feel. That way you will find yourself closer to the other person and dealing with the dispute, ending in a connection between two souls that feel each other and eventually come up with a solution that benefits everyone.

            <h3>Jasmine Tea</h3>
            <p>Jasmine tea is the perfect one to understand Mohism philosophy, the armony of jasmine blossoms and it's strong fragance mixes with black and white tea, two completely different teas in flavour and fragance leave the differences aside to make a perfectly balanced tea that will fill your soul when you are on your worst.</p>
