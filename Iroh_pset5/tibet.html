          <h1 class="page-title">Tibetan Buddhism</h1>
          <p>Tibetan Buddhism is a form of Mahayana Buddhism that developed in Tibet and spread to neighboring countries of the Himalayas. Tibetan Buddhism is built on the foundation of Mahayana philosophy and doctrines. It is distinguished by the use of esoteric rituals and other practices, especially tantra.
            <br><br>Tantra includes many different practices, but it is chiefly known as a means to enlightenment through identity with tantric deities. Tibetan deities are best understood as archetypes representing the tantric practitioner's own deepest nature. Through tantra yoga, one realizes the self as an enlightened being. These deities are not "believed in" as external spirits to be worshiped. Rather, they are archetypes representing the tantric practitioner's own deepest nature.
            <br><br>Unique to Tibetan Buddhism is the institution of the tulku (incarnate lama): Tibetan Buddhists believe that
            compassionate teachers are reborn again and again, in each lifetime identified when they are children and invested with the office and prestige of their previous rebirths. Tibet has had many such lamas, the most famous of whom is the Dalai Lama. The Fifth Dalai Lama became ruler of Tibet in 1642, and under his rule was built the great palace of the Potala in Lhasa, the countryâ€™s capital.
            <br><br>Vajrayana Buddhism, which is the form of Buddhism practiced in Tibet, provides a great variety of special practices, meditations and rituals to accomplish the goals of cultivating compassion and the ultimate liberation of all living beings. Vajrayana is based on the esoteric doctrines of Buddha Shakyamuni given to selected disciples. It uses yogic techniques of meditation, mantra, and ritual to bring about psychological and physiological transformations. Initiations and empowerments are needed to understand and engage in these techniques, and to use the sacred implements such as the vajra and ghanta (bell), sacred images (such as those in the museum collection), hand and body gestures (mudra), and sacred power words (mantra).

          <p class="dark">Monks became attached to tea by sitting in meditation. As shown in historical records, Shan Daokai, a famous monk of East Jin Dynasty, cultivated himself according to Buddhism doctrines at Zhaode Temple. He was assiduous in his practice of sitting in meditation. To recover from fatigue and drive away sleepiness, he drank tea. It showed that in the beginning, the purpose for monks in drinking tea is to facilitate meditation and self-cultivation. Sequel Biography of Famous Monks says that Shi Fayao, a monk of the Southern Dynasty, excelled in Sado. He lived for 79 years. One secret of his longevity was to drink tea with meals. Eventually, it became a common practice among monks under Buddhism doctrines.

            <h3>Butter Tea</h3>
            <p>Butter tea is a creamy hot Tibetan beverage with a melted butter-like appearance and salty flavour. Keeps the body warm and allows Tibetan people to resist the cold weather. In other words, this tea keeps the energy inside of you no matter what disturbance is on the outside. Meditation becomes an easy path when the problems can reach your inner self.  </p>
